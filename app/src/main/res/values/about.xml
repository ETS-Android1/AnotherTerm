<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Why another one? Just to have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>UART, SSH, Telnet and local pty support in the same application;</li>
    <li>Adequate screen input methods as long as a terminal requires specific keyboard
    functions.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>Minimum supported Android version is 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich.</li>
<li>Supported USB UART devices: Generic USB CDC, CP210X, FTDI, PL2303, CH34x, CP2130 SPI-USB.</li>
<li>Local Linux pty is supported. Feel free to use
<a href=\"https://github.com/green-green-avk/AnotherTerm/wiki/Installing-Linux-under-PRoot\">
PRoot with some Linux environment</a>.</li>
<li><a href=\"info://green_green_avk.anotherterm/termsh_man\">
Shell tool</a> to interact with the Android environment is also present.
<ul>
<li>Content exchange between other applications and own files / pipes has been implemented.</li>
<li>It also works in chrooted environments (PRoot at least).</li>
<li>USB serial port dongle access from the command line is also implemented.</li>
<li>libusb support on nonrooted Android
[<a href=\"https://github.com/green-green-avk/AnotherTerm/wiki/Installing-libusb-for-nonrooted-Android\">how to install</a>].
</li>
<li><a href=\"https://github.com/green-green-avk/AnotherTerm/wiki/Shell-plugins\">Custom plugins</a>
to access the Android environment and own API to create them as separate APKs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Telnet (no encryption).</li>
<li>Supported SSH features: zlib compression, port forwarding, password and public key authentication.</li>
<li>No MoSH, sorry.</li>
<li>Builtin screen keyboard and mouse.</li>

<h1>Notes</h1>
<p>Please, be aware, that key mapping of hardware input devices is provided by device vendors
and it could make some troubles.
For example: <em>ASUS ZenFone 4 Max</em> has the hardware keyboard <kbd>Home</kbd>
(<code>KEYCODE_MOVE_HOME</code>) key mapped as the Android middle (<code>KEYCODE_HOME</code>)
button that makes it effectively invisible for applications.
Most vendors also maps mouse right and middle buttons in some unexpected ways.
Fortunately, mouse buttons mapping can usually be worked around.
Most usual right mouse button mapping as the Android <kbd>Back</kbd> (<code>KEYCODE_BACK</code>)
button is supported by this application.
The only way to override the vendor\'s mapping is to root your device and change appropriate files
manually.</p>
<p>Due to an USB bug in Android itself, it\'s highly recommended not to use the USB UART
with devices running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop.

<h1>Cryptography usage note</h1>
<p>The only part of this application that touches on cryptography is the SSH client used to
communicate with remote systems. Currently this is provided by the JSch library.
It does not directly implement any encryption,
but instead relies on Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) and its providers that are a part of
Android.</p>
<p>This application is self-classified under ECCN 5D992 with the encryption authorization
type identifier MMKT.</p>
