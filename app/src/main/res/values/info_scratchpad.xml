        <h1>Scratchpad</h1>
        <p>The <i>scratchpad</i> feature has been added mostly to deal with
        the Android marshalling limitations
        and lack of the ability to track the content URI reference count.</p>
        <p>If you delete an entry after copying <i>or</i> sharing it,
        the clipboard content becomes obsolete <i>or</i> the recipient application could fail to use it
        if its content URI is still not opened <i>(very unlikely in the real world)</i> respectively.</p>
        <p><i><b>Note:</b> Applications could treat contents copied by value and by URI
        differently; for example:
        browsers usually ignore anything pasted into their search field
        if it is represented by the content URI only.</i></p>
