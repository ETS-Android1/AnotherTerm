        <h1>Scratchpad</h1>
        <p>The <i>scratchpad</i> feature has been added mostly to deal with
        the Android marshalling limitations
        and lack of the ability to track the content URI reference count.</p>
        <p>If you delete an entry after copying / sharing it,
        the clipboard content becomes obsolete / the recipient application could fail to use it
        if its content URI is still not opened <i>(very unlikely in the real world)</i>.</p>
